# Guidelines for sharing your slides/materials/repos to the PythonDay repository

First of all, **Thank you very much for participating in this event!** Your contribution is very much appreciated. Here
we present the guidelines for making your presentation materials available for everyone.

### Guidelines

#### General information

You can use everything you want but we highly recomend using a PDF format to avoid incompatibilities in proprietary software
and such.

Make sure you reference projects and important information in your slides so anyone who revisits your talk can follow what you
are talking about.

If you are giving a workshop, make sure to list all of your requirements so the attendants can code along with your examples.

Try not to surpass the limit time given to your talk, in order to move along we the schedule.

### Slides/other repos/materials

We are concentrating all the materials presented in PythonDayMexico as a link in the Readme document of this repository. We
ask you to comply with the following rules:

* Add one link per pull request. It can be a link to your personal repo containing all the materials needed to your talk/workshop
* Next to your link should be yor name and the title of your talk/workshop.
* Be sure that spelling and grammar are good.
	
Thank you for contributing and have fun at the event!
